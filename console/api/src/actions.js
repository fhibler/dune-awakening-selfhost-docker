// Console IAM — Action catalog with 1:1 route-to-action mapping.
//
// Every console route that requires authorization maps to exactly one
// action in this catalog. Routes that are always public (health, auth
// state, login/logout, Discord OAuth) do NOT appear here — they are
// handled before the authorization gate in server.js.
//
// The catalog is the single source of truth for what permissions exist.
// The IAM policy engine and the UI editor both read from this catalog
// to know what actions can be granted or denied.
//
// Naming convention: namespace:action-name (e.g. "players:kick",
// "bases:refill-generators", "server:restart")
//
// ---- WHEN ADDING A NEW ROUTE IN server.js (hard requirement) ----
//
// 1. If the route requires authorization: add it to ROUTE_ACTIONS below
//    in the same commit. Follow the existing "METHOD /path": "ns:action"
//    format exactly — one line, alphabetically grouped by namespace.
//
// 2. If the route is always public (no IAM action needed): add the EXACT
//    path to the PUBLIC_EXACT array in test/rbacParity.test.js. The
//    parity test statically extracts every route from server.js and
//    asserts 100% coverage — a missing entry is a hard test failure.
//
// 3. Verify: `node --test test/rbacParity.test.js` must pass before push.
//    This gate enforces the requirement mechanically.

  //
  //   guilds:disband     destroys the guild. Irreversible.
  //   guilds:membership  add and remove. Removal costs a player their
  //                      guild-derived access, so it sits above rank and below
  //                      disband. Add/remove stay one action: two directions of
  //                      the same roster knob. Split if a one-way case appears.
  //   guilds:rank        promote/demote. Rank only; nobody joins or leaves.
  //
  // Both DELETE patterns are anchored so "/api/guilds/{id}" and
  // "/api/guilds/{id}/members/{playerId}" cannot be confused -- the variable
  // segment comes before the distinguishing part, so a startsWith prefix (as
  // bases:delete also found) is not enough.

  // ---- Blueprints ----

  // ---- Addons ----
  //
  // addons:mutate covered lifecycle AND the bridge -- the route that executes
  // whatever the addon's manifest declares, including SQL. Lifecycle control
  // and "run the addon's code" are not the same privilege.
  //
  //   addons:remove  uninstall an installed addon
  //   addons:toggle  enable/disable, the reversible lifecycle switch
  //   addons:bridge  the manifest-authorized action channel. Authorizes
  //                  against the INSTALLED ADDON's declared permission, not the
  //                  caller (server.js addonBridgeRoute) -- which is why it is
  //                  withheld separately.
  //
  // API keys cannot reach any of these regardless: `addons` is in
  // KEY_WRITE_DENIED_NAMESPACES, and the bridge additionally refuses key
  // principals outright.

// ---- Content-conditional actions ----
//
// Actions that no entry above resolves to, because the action depends on the
// request BODY rather than on its method and path. actionForRoute runs in the
// gate, before any body is read, so these cannot be resolved there; they are
// enforced by a second check inside the handler (server.js requireAction) once
// the body is parsed.
//
// Listed here so allKnownActions() sees them: that set feeds the API-key scope
// catalog and any policy-authoring tool, so an action missing from it is
// invisible to every tool an operator has.
//
//   database:execute -- the write half of POST /api/database/query, which
//     resolves to the read-shaped database:query at the route level. Admin is
//     granted database:query while denied database:mutate (the narrow
//     single-cell edit) and database:write-config, so without this the raw-SQL
//     path defeated the Deny on the structured one. Denied to admin by default.
//     Selection is best-effort (see duneDb.runSql); the read path is enforced
//     by Postgres, not by this action.
export const CONTENT_CONDITIONAL_ACTIONS = [
  "database:execute",

// ---- Removed actions, and what they became ----
//
// Deleting a split action ESCALATES an existing policy rather than narrowing
// it. policy.js's header teaches the idiom
//
//     { "Effect": "Deny",  "Action": ["players:mutate"] },
//     { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["players:*"] }
//
// With the name gone the Deny matches nothing and the wildcard matches all ten
// successors, turning "no player mutations" into "every player mutation" -- 22
// actions gained on upgrade, including addons:bridge and guilds:disband.
//
// So the old names keep their MEANING in matchAction (a Deny still denies what
// it denied, an Allow still grants what it granted) while setPolicies refuses
// them on save, naming the successors. Aliases are NOT in the catalog and
// cannot be granted to an API key.
//
// Each list is exactly what the old name's routes resolve to now, no more.
// players:kick-all is ABSENT: it was already its own ROUTE_ACTIONS entry
// (POST /api/players/kick-all-online), so it was never part of players:mutate.
// The *:unclassified sentinels ARE included -- the old *:mutate names were
// themselves the catch-all for unmapped mutating routes.
