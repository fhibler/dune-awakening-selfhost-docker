# --- Case 55: host-shaped state in generated/ survives the extract ---------
# runtime/generated/ is restored wholesale, which is right for the server's own
# state and wrong for the two files that describe THIS machine:
#
#   battlegroup-restore-point.env  names the id this host had before the
#     restore. The extract lands the archive's copy over it, so the rollback
#     point ends up describing the SOURCE host -- and publicDirectory's
#     `adoptedKey === currentKey` guard passes with it, migrating
#     public-directory state from an installation this host never was.
#
#   battlegroup.env's SERVER_IP/SERVER_IP_MODE are preserved in .env and then
#     overruled here, because every consumer sources .env first and
#     battlegroup.env second. It only looked like it worked because
#     ensure-public-ip.sh rewrites the file on the next start -- and it returns
#     early unless SERVER_IP_MODE is "public", so a local-mode host advertised
#     the old machine's address.
#
# The archive is built inline rather than via make_restorable_archive so the
# SOURCE tree can carry a rollback point of its own: without one in the archive
# there is nothing to clobber the host's, and the case would pass either way.
