# The deferred dimension reconcile waits for Survival_1/Overmap to be READY --
# minutes, on a cold start -- and then spawns any Sietch dimension that has no
# server. It used to run as a background job of start-all.sh, inside the console
# container, so `dune console reload` (a docker rm -f on that container) killed
# it mid-wait. A system restore reloads the console seconds after starting the
# stack, so it was killed every time and the second Sietch never spawned.
#
# The first cases pin the shape of the launch: that it is detached from the
# console, that it carries what spawn-server.sh needs, and that a host without
# the console image still gets a reconcile. The last two pin that a step which
# fails says so, rather than being swallowed by a bare `|| true`.
