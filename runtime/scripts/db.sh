Backups are written as official-style .backup files with a .backup.yaml sidecar.
Import accepts official .backup files and older dune-db-*.dump or .sql backups.
Import requires confirmation and creates a pre-import backup first unless --no-safety-backup is used.
When the backup and current Battlegroup IDs differ, import requires an explicit
choice to adopt the backup identity or keep the current identity. Adopting is
the normal choice when moving the same server to new hardware; keeping the
current identity is for intentionally importing data into a different server.

dune db backup-system requires GnuPG 2.3 or newer, for authenticated
(AEAD/OCB) encryption. It bundles a fresh database dump together with .env,
runtime/generated/, and runtime/secrets/ into one encrypted
dune-system-*.tar.gz.enc archive under runtime/backups/system/ (with a
matching .yaml sidecar containing no secrets, safe to read/share on its
own). Every credential is retained -- the Funcom Self-Host Service Token,
admin console password, RMQ admin credentials, and the sietch join
password are all included verbatim, not redacted or excluded. The
archive's only protection is the passphrase you set when creating it,
encrypted with AES-256 in AEAD (OCB) mode via gpg -- an authenticated
cipher mode, not just confidentiality: a corrupted or tampered archive
is rejected outright at decrypt time rather than silently producing
wrong or manipulated plaintext. You will be prompted for a passphrase
interactively (entered twice, to catch typos); for non-interactive/cron
use, set DUNE_SYSTEM_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE in the environment instead. There
is no way to recover an encrypted system backup without its passphrase --
store the passphrase somewhere durable and separate from the archive
itself (a password manager, not the same disk).

The archive is written 600 (owner read/write only) as defense in depth,
but do not rely on filesystem permissions alone -- treat a copy of this
archive as equivalent to a copy of your Funcom token the moment it leaves
this host, unless you are confident in the passphrase's strength.

To decrypt and extract (also printed in the archive's own .yaml sidecar
and on stdout when the backup is created). Enter the passphrase at the
prompt -- do not put it directly on the command line, which would expose
it to any other process on this host via `ps`/`/proc/<pid>/cmdline` for
as long as gpg is running.

Decrypt to a file FIRST and let gpg's exit status gate the extract. The
authentication tag is verified at the END of the stream, so piping
`gpg -d | tar -x` directly extracts almost the whole archive before the
tamper is detected, and tar exiting 0 hides gpg's failure:
  read -r -s -p "Passphrase: " p; echo
  printf '%s' "$p" | gpg --batch --yes --pinentry-mode loopback \
    --passphrase-fd 0 -d <archive> > restore.tar.gz \
    && tar -xzf restore.tar.gz
  unset p; rm -f restore.tar.gz
If gpg reports a checksum error, restore.tar.gz is untrustworthy however
complete it looks -- delete it rather than extracting it.

To restore one: dune db restore-system <archive> [--dry-run]
[--adopt-backup-battlegroup|--keep-current-battlegroup]
[--adopt-backup-audit-log|--keep-current-audit-log]. It restores the
database first (while .env still describes the database it can reach), then
.env, runtime/generated/ and runtime/secrets/, copying whatever it replaces
to runtime/backups/restore-<timestamp>/ first. It does NOT restart the
stack: .env may carry different database credentials and a different admin
console password, so you choose when that takes effect.
