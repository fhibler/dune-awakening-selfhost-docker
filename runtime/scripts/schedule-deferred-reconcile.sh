# Starts the deferred dimension reconcile so that it OUTLIVES the console.
#
# It used to be a background job of start-all.sh, which the console runs inside
# its own container. `dune console reload` is `docker rm -f` on that container,
# so anything start-all backgrounded died with it -- and the reconcile is a wait
# that can legitimately run for minutes while Survival_1 warms up. A system
# restore reloads the console seconds after starting the stack, so the wait was
# killed every time and the second Sietch of a multi-dimension map never
# spawned. Nothing reported it: the wait prints nothing until it finishes, and
# deferred-reconcile.sh calls the reconcile with `|| true`.
#
# The helper is a detached container, so a console recreate cannot reach it. It
# needs the repo and the docker socket because the reconcile spawns game
# servers, and it needs the host-path translation environment because
# spawn-server.sh refuses to build bind mounts without it.
