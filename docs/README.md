# Documentation Index

This folder mirrors the repo's own structure: component docs live under a folder
named for the component they document (`console/`, `runtime/`, `addons/`), while
docs that span the whole product or are pure assets stay at this root
(`screenshots.md`). Cross-cutting concerns (`security/`, `incidents/`) get their
own top-level folders.

Docs marked **Historical record** describe a point-in-time state (a branch, a PR,
an issue) and are not kept up to date — read them for context, not as current
reference.

Docs marked **Observed** describe the closed-source game — its database schema,
its services, its mechanics — rather than anything in this repo. They are
maintained, but they cannot be kept accurate by reviewing our own changes,
because nothing here causes them to drift: a Funcom build does. Each one names
the game build it was verified against, so a reader can tell how stale it might
be. Treat an `Observed` claim older than the running build as unverified until
re-checked against a live database or container.

Everything else is marked **Current** and is expected to stay accurate as this
repo's code changes.

## Adding a new doc

1. **Pick the folder by what the doc documents, not what kind of doc it is.**
   If it explains a piece of `console/api` or `console/web`, it goes in
   `docs/console/`. If it explains something under `runtime/`, it goes in
   `docs/runtime/`. Addon-platform behavior goes in `docs/addons/`. Only use
   `docs/security/` or `docs/incidents/` for concerns that cut across
   components (a vulnerability class, a post-incident review) rather than a
   single feature. Don't add a new top-level folder for one document — put it
   in the closest existing one.
2. **Decide the status up front**, and put the line right after the
   H1, matching the existing docs:
   - Living reference that should be kept accurate as code changes:
     `**Status:** Current | **Last Updated:** <Month Year>`
   - A description of the closed-source game rather than of this repo — schema,
     services, mechanics, anything only a running build can confirm:
     `**Status:** Observed — verified against game build <build> (<Month Year>). Re-verify after a game update.`
     Cite the evidence inline (the query, the container, the log line) so the
     next person can re-run it rather than re-derive it. Prefer this over
     `Current` whenever a claim would survive our review unchanged while
     quietly becoming false — that has already happened here.
   - A frozen snapshot of a PR, branch, or issue — a test report, a change
     summary, implementation notes — goes in `docs/archive/` with:
     `**Status:** Historical record — describes the state at <PR/branch/issue>. Not maintained.`
     Add a pointer to the current doc that superseded it, if one exists.
3. **Add one line to this index**, in the matching section above: a link, one
   sentence of purpose, and the status word. A doc with no line here is
   effectively invisible — this file is the only thing every other doc is
   guaranteed to be reachable from.
4. **Cross-link the doc's nearest relatives** (the feature doc it complements,
   the security review of the same code path, the API reference section that
   covers its endpoints) directly in the doc body, not just in this index.

## Architecture

A deliberate exception to this file's own "don't add a new top-level
folder for one document" rule above: a whole-system overview doesn't
belong to any single existing folder (`console/`, `runtime/`, `addons/`)
by nature, so it gets its own.

- [architecture/SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md](architecture/SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md) — Current. Whole-system engineering architecture reference: component map, the console's API/web/data layers, the `dune` CLI and Compose-project-name resolution, runtime state directories, and the Discord-integration split. Start here for a code-level overview before diving into a single component's docs.
- [architecture/CONTAINER-ENGINES.md](architecture/CONTAINER-ENGINES.md) — Current. Docker and Podman: why Podman is supported by pointing the real Docker CLI and Compose v2 at Podman's Docker-compatible socket rather than by rewriting call sites, the `runtime/scripts/lib/engine.sh` seam that describes every genuine behavioural difference, why engine-socket access is root-equivalent on both engines, host prerequisites, the known gaps, the `tests/podman-host-gate.sh` on-host gate that puts the twelve questions only a real enforcing Podman host can settle into one auditable run, and the recorded decision not to put the stack in one Podman pod.
- [architecture/DATABASE.md](architecture/DATABASE.md) — Observed. The `dune` database: the encryption view layer, `world_partition` event-log provisioning, the eight notify channels and why direct DML is often a silent no-op, capability probes, the objects the console creates itself, and a domain map of the game's tables. Deliberately documents mechanisms rather than transcribing a schema that drifts with every game build — regenerate the inventory with `runtime/scripts/schema-report.sh`.
- [architecture/SERVICES.md](architecture/SERVICES.md) — Observed. The always-on closed-source services (TextRouter, Director, Gateway, the two RabbitMQ brokers): each one's role and trust boundary, the messaging authorization topology (both brokers delegate all auth to TextRouter), the real startup order, and a failure-to-symptom map. Game servers are out of scope.
- [architecture/WORLD-MODEL.md](architecture/WORLD-MODEL.md) — Observed. How the game addresses world space: map, dimension and partition as columns on `dune.world_partition`, why world state is keyed by `(map, dimension_index)`, and the full partition catalog of live worlds and on-demand content maps.

## Console (`console/api`, `console/web`)

- [API-REFERENCE.md](console/API-REFERENCE.md) — Current. Full HTTP API reference for every console endpoint.
- [api-keys.md](console/api-keys.md) — Current. Named, revocable API keys for external callers: scopes that default to no access, given per namespace as Read/Read+write or as an explicit list of actions, the `settings`/`database`/`setup` namespaces no key can ever reach and the write-denied `updates` and `addons`, hash-only storage with a one-time reveal, and per-key expiry, disable and rate limits.
- [blueprints.md](console/blueprints.md) — Current. Blueprint import/export developer documentation.
- [PRE-AUGMENTED-GEAR.md](console/PRE-AUGMENTED-GEAR.md) — Current. API reference for granting gear with augments pre-applied.
- [generator-fuel-burn-rates.md](console/generator-fuel-burn-rates.md) — Current. Per-generator fuel burn constants and where they live in code.
- [generator-refill-caps.md](console/generator-refill-caps.md) — Current. Refill-generators endpoint behavior and per-type fuel caps.
- [base-permissions.md](console/base-permissions.md) — Current. Editing base ownership and sharing: ranks, the config-driven roster cap, and why the change needs no map restart.
- [base-child-permissions.md](console/base-child-permissions.md) — Current. The Base Permissions tab: the per-piece access-level scale (Public/Guild/Associate/Co-Owner/Owner), why Associate is "Sub-Fief," setting individual pieces to a specific level, and the pending-permission queue for a live map.
- [vehicle-permissions.md](console/vehicle-permissions.md) — Current. Editing vehicle ownership and sharing: the same roster engine as base permissions, including the Transfer to Custodian action.
- [base-inventory.md](console/base-inventory.md) — Current. The base Inventory tab: which placeables count as storage, the two inventories every refinery carries, per-slot container contents, and the Give/Fill/Delete container actions (none of which require a stopped map).
- [vehicle-storage.md](console/vehicle-storage.md) — Current. The Vehicles → Components View Contents overlay: which module counts as storage, why a vehicle's cargo hangs off its actor id rather than the (empty) `vehicle_module_id` link, and why the view is read-only.
- [base-deletion.md](console/base-deletion.md) — Current. Permanently deleting a base: what "the base" means for enumeration, the pending-delete queue for a live map, the mandatory pre-delete safety backup, and why a pending delete freezes every other mutation on that base.
- [vehicle-deletion.md](console/vehicle-deletion.md) — Current. Permanently deleting a vehicle: the FK cascade closure verified against a real schema dump, its own parallel pending-delete queue, and the vehicle-specific `dune.actors.state` guard bases have no equivalent of.
- [base-backups.md](console/base-backups.md) — Current. What the game's own "pick up base" tool actually does in the database, why the Bases panel excludes a picked-up base, and the Coriolis compatibility patch that preserves saved Deep Desert base actors.
- [database-backups.md](console/database-backups.md) — Current. Safe database restore behavior when the backup and current deployment use different Battlegroup IDs, and encrypted system backups that carry configuration and secrets to a new host.
- [deleted-characters.md](console/deleted-characters.md) — Current. Find characters deleted from the server that still hold bases or vehicles.
- [restart-queue.md](console/restart-queue.md) — Current. The Restart Queue toggle: player-aware countdowns with in-game warnings, the two broadcast variants, concurrency rules, crash recovery, the "Restart later" deferred-restart option, and the join-lock limitation.
- [exchange.md](console/exchange.md) — Current. The read-only Market Board: aggregated-by-item CHOAM exchange listings, seller resolution, how bot listings are identified, the bot/blacklist filter config, the Market Bot seed/buyback engine, and the Bot items tab's per-item catalog overrides.
- [live-map.md](console/live-map.md) — Current. The Live Map panel: partition display-name resolution, the actor/spice/POI marker data model (static archive + live decode + self-learning pool, the registry-driven POI framework), the Layers legend's hide-if-empty and default-settings mechanism, Coriolis seed/layout/countdown resolution, and the WebGL terrain renderer that draws the Deep Desert's own cartography meshes (with the conditions under which it falls back to the flat map image).

- [E2E-METRICS-TESTING.md](runtime/E2E-METRICS-TESTING.md) — Current. End-to-end validation procedure for the metrics stack (`runtime/metrics`).
- [MULTI-SERVER-SINGLE-PUBLIC-IP.md](runtime/MULTI-SERVER-SINGLE-PUBLIC-IP.md) — Current. Executive overview and detailed SOP for running multiple isolated battlegroups behind one public IPv4, including full per-instance port profiles, NAT/hairpin requirements, UserEngine configuration, validation, rollback, and the `multi-server-config.py` automation helper.

## Addons

- [addon-item-grants.md](addons/addon-item-grants.md) — Current. The `admin:grant-items` permissioned addon item grant flow.

## Security

All four docs below describe controls that are still in force; they are marked
historical because they read as point-in-time PR records, not because the
control itself is stale.

- [addon-provenance.md](security/addon-provenance.md) — Historical record. Community addon discovery and code-signing threat model.
- [generated-command-auth-token.md](security/generated-command-auth-token.md) — Historical record. Command auth token generation hardening.
- [login-rate-limit-defense.md](security/login-rate-limit-defense.md) — Historical record. Login rate limiting defense.
- [pre-augmented-gear-grant.md](security/pre-augmented-gear-grant.md) — Historical record. Security review of the pre-augmented gear grant path — see [PRE-AUGMENTED-GEAR.md](console/PRE-AUGMENTED-GEAR.md) for current reference.

## Incidents

- [INC-2026-07-24-STEAMCMD-CDN-OUTAGE.md](incidents/INC-2026-07-24-STEAMCMD-CDN-OUTAGE.md) — Historical record. Post-incident case study: SteamCMD content-host failure.
